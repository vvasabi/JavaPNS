h2. JavaPNS

This is a fork of JavaPNS library from "Google Code":http://code.google.com/p/javapns/. This fork makes the following changes:

* Build tool switches from ant to mvn for simple dependency management.
* Source controlled with git.

Note that the author of JavaPNS uses a modified version of org.json library, and the modified source is included in this release. Be aware of potential conflict that may arise when your project also uses org.json library.

Since this is an unofficial repository, I make no promise of keeping it up-to-date. Use this repository at your own risk.
